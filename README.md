# Gas station Implementation
<br>
Designing and developing a Fuel Dispenser Management System and Queue Management System to be installed in a Gas and Service Station
<br>
The station is equipped with 4, 92Octane dispensers, connected to one central 92Octane repository and 3 Diesel dispensers, also connected to one central repository. Customers may form queues for each dispenser (based on the vehicle type).
<br>
<br>
Only 10 customers may form a queue for each serving dispenser (some dispensers may not operate due to lack of manpower). A ticket is issued through the Queue Management System to each customer in each queue. The number of available positions in each queue is displayed when a customer first enters the Gas Station. If a queue has reached 10 vehicles, the next customer may join the common waiting queue, and will be able to join the next vacant queue position for the appropriate dispenser.
<br>
<br>
The two central fuel repositories have a capacity of 25,000L each. When the capacity of a repository reaches 500L the dispensing of that fuel type will be stopped until it is re-stocked. 1L of 92Octance is priced at Rs. 450 and Diesel is priced at Rs. 430.
